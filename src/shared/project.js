      "As a creative portfolio project, I started building this simple website for showing off digital art projects in a way that hadn't been done before: with integrity metrics. I did some experimentation with CSS here, and would like to refine it to include graphs to visually demonstrate a project's integrity through metrics like team experience and accountability, roadmap followthrough, popularity on different platforms, and rating their art, marketing, community, etc.",
