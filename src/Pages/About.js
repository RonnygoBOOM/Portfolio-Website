                    Thanks for taking the time to check out my portfolio! This is very much a work in progress, but I will keep improving and adding content week by week as I continue on my growth journey as a web developer.

                    I started dabbling into code a few years ago when I wanted to create some custom plugins for my Minecraft server, and when I decided to change careers, this was a no-brainer. I found some free courses online and had some great mentors and encouragers in my life, especially my wife, Candice, and my good friends Steve L. and Eli G., who gave me the perspective and direction I needed to set some goals, and accomplish them. Since spring of 2021, I have complete CS50 through Harvard University's online platform, taught myself the basics of CSS, Javascript, and HTML, and then earned a certification in front end libraries through NuCamp coding Bootcamp for the MERN stack.

                    Since then, I have been following tutorials, coming up with my own creative ideas, and building projects every day, and often live-streaming my progress to help hold myself accountable for my own growth and learning.
